# Usage

## Camera activating tutorial

To be able to use our application, you must allow it to use our camera, but because (as of right now), we are using the http protocol rather than the https protocol, when viewing our application, it won't prompt you permission to use your camera and will instead block it. We need to bypass this, we will give you a tutorial here. It is possible among all browsers to do this, but it's easiest for chrome, and we assume almost everyone uses and if not has chrome downloaded. If you are using another browser, please look up 'How to allow non secure http website camera access'. Now on with the tutorial. 

Before joining our website, look up on your google chrome search bar `chrome://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure` and enable the flag. You must also type in or paste our website address here: `http://163.192.0.247`. Now you must restart chrome, there should be some sort of button that shows when you have enabled the flag to do so, do so. Now you have everything you need to be able to start

## Using the platform

Now you can go ahead and visit [our website]http://163.192.0.247 and start a game!
